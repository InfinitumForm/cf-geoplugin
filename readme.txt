There are over a couple thousand plugins and a couple of few million individual WordPress installations. We cannot 100% guarantee that everything will work properly in all possible cases. Sometimes it happens that other plugins are not compatible with CF Geo Plugin, so it is important that you contact us or other plugin authors in case of any problem so that you can solve the problem.

= Basics usage and example =

`[cfgeo_flag]
[cfgeo]
[cfgeo_city]
[cfgeo return="region"]
We just found shoes in [cfgeo_city] that you can buy for 50% discount.
[cfgeo ip="127.0.0.1" return="area_code"]
[cfgeo exclude="Toronto"] This text is seeing by everyone except Toronto people [/cfgeo]
[cfgeo include="New York"] This text seeing only people from New York [/cfgeo]
[in_eu]You are from the European Union[/in_eu]
[not_in_eu]You are NOT from the European Union[/not_in_eu]
[is_vat]You are under VAT[/is_vat]
[is_not_vat]You are NOT under VAT[/is_not_vat]`

= Usage & Example =

To best understand how shortcodes work, it's best to [read the documentation](https://cfgeoplugin.com/documentation/quick-start/cf-geoplugin-shortcodes/).

But here are some simple examples:

**Coronavirus information (COVID-19 informations)** Using shortcodes or tags you can display global or country based Coronavirus informations in the real time:

`[cfgeo_covid19_total_cases]
[cfgeo_covid19_total_recovered]
[cfgeo_covid19_total_unresolved]
[cfgeo_covid19_total_deaths]
[cfgeo_covid19_total_new_cases_today]
[cfgeo_covid19_total_new_deaths_today]
[cfgeo_covid19_total_active_cases]
[cfgeo_covid19_total_serious_cases]
[cfgeo_covid19_mortality_rate]
[cfgeo_covid19_recovery_rate]

[cfgeo_covid19_global_total_cases]
[cfgeo_covid19_global_total_recovered]
[cfgeo_covid19_global_total_unresolved]
[cfgeo_covid19_global_total_deaths]
[cfgeo_covid19_global_total_new_cases_today]
[cfgeo_covid19_global_total_new_deaths_today]
[cfgeo_covid19_global_total_active_cases]
[cfgeo_covid19_global_total_serious_cases]
[cfgeo_covid19_global_mortality_rate]
[cfgeo_covid19_global_recovery_rate]`

**GEO PLUGIN:** Usage is simple. After installation and activation, in your post you just need to insert `[cfgeo]` shortcode and that's it. Enter a shortcode as this and it returns and displays the IP address to a visitor. If you like to display regions (for example California for users who are from California), you just need to use the `return` attribute in your shortcode like this: `[cfgeo return="region"]`. By changing the return settings, you can display any information from the list above. Each user who comes to the site will see information related to their area. 

If you want to track some custom IP and return some information from that IP, you can do that by adding one optional attribute ip like on example `[cfgeo ip="127.0.0.1" return="area_code"]` what will return area code from that IP address.

If you like to add default values to your shortcode if data is empty you need to add extra attribute in your shortcode like this example `[cfgeo return="country_code" default="US"]` what will return US if geoplugin can't locate country code.

If you need to exclude some content from your page based on user location, you can do that using the `exclude` attribute like this: 

`[cfgeo exclude="Toronto, Québec"] This text is seeing by everyone except people from Toronto and Québec [/cfgeo]`

If you need to display some content in your page based on user location, you can do that using the `include` attribute like this: 

`[cfgeo include="New York, Miami, Germany"] This text seeing only people from New York, Miami and Germany [/cfgeo]`

**VAT CONTROL:** If you need to show *value-added tax (VAT)* information on your website, there are 2 shortcodes that can help you with it.

`[is_vat]You are under VAT[/is_vat]
[is_not_vat]You are NOT under VAT[/is_not_vat]`

Both shortcodes have a default option that you can use as an alternative.

`[is_vat default="You are NOT under VAT"]You are under VAT[/is_vat]
[is_not_vat default="You are under VAT"]You are NOT under VAT[/is_not_vat]`

Generally, these two shortcodes show or hide everything inside it, depending on your needs.

**EU CONTROL:** If you need to display some content related to *European Union (EU)* countries, you can do it on the two easy way:

`[in_eu]You are from the European Union[/in_eu]
[not_in_eu]You are NOT from the European Union[/not_in_eu]`

Like many of our shortcodes, there is default options what you can use as an alternative:

`[in_eu default="You are NOT from the European Union"]You are from the European Union[/in_eu]
[not_in_eu defauilt="You are from the European Union"]You are NOT from the European Union[/not_in_eu]`

These two shortcodes also show or hide everything inside it, depending on your needs.

**GOOGLE MAP:** If you want to place a simple Google Map in your post or page, you just need to place a shortcode [cfgeo_map] and your visitor will see their own location on Google Map by default.

Like example, you can display own company street address inside Google Map like this: `[cfgeo_map longitude="-74.0059" latitude="40.7128" zoom="15"]` and pointer will show your street and place where you work.

Google Map also allow you to use HTML inside map and display info bar: 

`[cfgeo_map longitude="-74.0059" latitude="40.7128" zoom="15" title="My Company Name"] 
   <h3>My Company Name<h3> 
   <p>No Name Street 35, New York, USA</p> 
   <p>We have what you need</p> 
[/cfgeo_map]`

With this plugin you can easily set up your Google Map.

**GEO BANNER:** With this plugin you also have the ability to make dynamic content (text, images, banners, videos...) and target your messages to people from certain regions, track IP address, setup WordPress to work on user's timezone, etc. The possibilities are huge, you can increase conversions, use this plugin like support for your custom template, build your own plugin and use CF Geo Plugin like additional options, etc.

You just need to create a new banner, place your content, select rules (country, region, city) save your banner, after that in your page pickup banner shortcode and place inside content.

**COUNTRY FLAG** You can display country flags in text or like images.

If you like to display country flag in your text like icon, you can do that simple like: 

`[cfgeo_flag]` - and you will see a flag in your text.

If you like to display country flag in your content like image, you can do that also simple using img or image attributes like: 

`[cfgeo_flag img]` - and you will see image flag in your content

You also can give custom sizes of flags in %, px, in, pt or em using size attribute like this: 

`[cfgeo_flag size="32px"]` - and you will see your flag in that size. You can use this size in image and normal text mode also.

You also can display custom flag using country attribute by placing country code simple like: 

`[cfgeo_flag country="ca"]` - and you will see a flag in your text or like image.

We allow you also full control of this flags and you can place css, class or id attributes to be able use this in any kind of work like this: 

`[cfgeo_flag size="50" css="padding:10px;" class="your-custom-class custom-class custom" id="top-flag"]`

Flags also support include & exclude attributes where you can controls your flag view:

`[cfgeo_flag exclude="ca,us"]` - and you will hide flag from the USA and Canada, for other is visible

or

`[cfgeo_flag include="ca,us"]` - and you will show flag only inside USA and Canada, for others is hidden

~ Your CF Geo Plugin Team

== Installation ==

You only need to install the  **CF Geo Plugin** through the WordPress plugins screen directly or download ZIP file, unpack and upload plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.

Afterwards, activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress, go to your `http://siteexample.com/wp-admin/` area and use the `Settings->CF Geo Plugin` to see all available shortcodes and settings.

= On uninstall =

You must know when you uninstall CF Geo Plugin you will lose complete setup, license and any other changes you have inside your WordPress installation. On uninstall we clean everything from your database that our plugin generates and you can not return that information back.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is CF Geo Plugin free? Is there some license or restrictions? =

CF Geo Plugin uses a combination of free and paid services that return information about the locations.

CF Geo Plugin is free by itself but API lookup is limited to 300 lookups per day for the free users. If you need to have UNLIMITED lookup with NO RESTRICTIONS, please visit [official website](https://cfgeoplugin.com/pricing/) for more information regarding prices.

The reason for the payment of the license is obvious: -We have to pay the server we use to provide you information via API, development requires hours and hours of work at the daily level, the availability of the service must be 24/7 with no stop and for a lot of coffee.

Also you must know that few options like REST API, WooCommerce Payment Options, Spam Protection, Currency Converter are locked for the unlicensed usage because those options rely on the unlimited lookups and can break the website or stop working when you reach limits.

= Do CF Geo Plugin use 3rd party services? =

CF Geo Plugin is a geo information provider and we provide our own geo information via API services builded on the CF Geo Plugin servers. CF Geo Plugin has its own databases of IP addresses and geo locations related to that IP addresses. CF Geo Plugin may use inside own API service and 3rd party API services like [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com/en/home), [GeoIP](http://php.net/manual/en/intro.geoip.php) and [Geo Plugin](https://www.geoplugin.com/) like additional support for the certain informations for the more precise location or currency information.

Note that CF Geo Plugin DO NOT STORE any personal information without your knowledge and approval and not provide personal information to 3rd parties. CF Geo Plugin not selling and not providing own databases to 3rd parties in any case. We handle only with world wide public information that is visible to anyone (client IP, server IP, hostname) and using simple processes we return geo information and following services.

For more informations you visit [Terms and Conditions](https://cfgeoplugin.com/terms-and-conditions) and [Privacy Policy](https://cfgeoplugin.com/privacy-policy) pages on our [official website](https://cfgeoplugin.com).

= How I can test CF Geo Plugin is work on certain country, region or city? =

That part is a little bit hard but you can use great VPN service - [NordVPN](https://goo.gl/AEd82e)
With this service you can change your current location and test CF Geo Plugin and its functionality.

= Can I use CF Geop Plugin inside a custom template? =

Yes! You can! You just need to follow instructions from your admin panel `http://siteexample.com/wp-admin/` area and use the `Settings->CF Geo Plugin` to see all available shortcodes and settings.
NOTE: Some templates do not support WordPress PHP function `[do_shortcode()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/do_shortcode/)` and data from CF Geo Plugin will not be visible.

= Can GeoPlugin slow down my site? =

NO, CF Geo Plugin uses the asynchronous data reading from API services. After loading, all data is stored in a session. That session is stored until IP is changed. When the user's IP changes, the plugin reads new data and stores in the new session.

= Can I set the different value if the shortcode shows no results? =

YES, just add the attribute `default` in shortcode and corresponding text like this:
`[cfgeo return="city" default="Your Default Text"]`

= How to include CF Geop Plugin in PHP? =

In PHP you can use WordPress function `[do_shortcode()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/do_shortcode/)` to display data via shortcode inside your PHP file. Also you have option to use PHP class `new CF_Geoplugin` or you can use GLOBALS and get data via `global $CF_Geo` like example:

`
// check if plugin exists
if(class_exists("CF_Geoplugin")){
	// include plugin class
	$cfgeo = new CF_Geoplugin;
	// get data
	$geo = $cfgeo->get();
	// print data
	echo $geo->city;
}
`

or with globals:

`
// object oriented
global $CF_GEO;
echo $CF_GEO->city;

// Array
global $CFGEO;
echo $CFGEO['city'];
`

= How to use CF Geop Plugin inside JavaScript? =

JavaScript is enabled from version 5.2.0. In JavaScript you have 2 ways to get geo data from our plugin, using `cf.geoplugin` or `window.cfgeo` objects. These 2 objects contain all geo information from our plugin and are available inside the public and admin area.
`
<script>
	// Look in your console for all available objects
	console.log(window.cfgeo);
	
	// you can use this everywhere you want
	
	var city = window.cfgeo.city,
		state = window.cfgeo.state,
		country = window.cfgeo.country,
		ip = window.cfgeo.ip;
</script>
`

= How to use CF Geo Plugin inside ContactForm7? =

Sometimes you need to include other HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and jQuery codes inside ContactForm7. Sometimes you need to insert a geolocation in input fields. This is not easy but here is one example with jQuery:

`
[text* city placeholder "* City Name"]
[text* country placeholder "* Country Name"]

<script>
jQuery(document).ready(function(){
    jQuery("input[name^='city']").val(window.cfgeo.city);
	jQuery("input[name^='country']").val(window.cfgeo.country);
});
</script>
`

This code will auto fill the value of CF7 city field when a visitor visits the contact page (look screenshots).

* All geo information you can find inside the global `window.cfgeo` object.

= CF Geo Plugin don't display information =

* It might be an error with the provider's [geoPlugin](http://www.geoplugin.com/) network or API and CF Geo Plugin can't display information on its own.
* Look inside `CF Geo Plugin` for all available shortcodes and settings,
* Look inside `CF Geo Plugin->Settings` and enable/disable and check all options (SSL, proxy, etc),
* Maybe you have PHP error, you can see that if you enable plugin debug in `wp-config.php` inserting on first lines code: `define('WP_CF_GEO_DEBUG', true);`
* Some people use a special software to hide IP address via proxy and geoplugin can't look deeper to get accurate location,
* Look into error.log file to see if a problem is in CF Geo Plugin
* Some servers not allow access to geoplugin sites and maybe you need to use proxy settings inside plugin to enable tracking
* You reach some API limitations

Please inform us if any of these errors occur via contact form on our website [http://creativform.com](http://creativform.com/contact/) with message subject: **CF Geo Plugin SUPPORT**
