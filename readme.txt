Unlock the power of location-based functionality of WordPress - The ultimate all-in-one geolocation plugin for WordPress.

== Description ==

Are you ready to level up your WordPress game? Meet **[Geo Controller](https://cfgeoplugin.com/)** (formerly known as CF Geo Plugin), the ultimate geo-marketing tool that will give you full control of your website's geographic information.

With Geo Controller for WordPress, you can automatically detect the location of your website's visitors and display it on your website, giving you the ability to greet your visitors with a personalized message like "Welcome to our website, [visitor's city]!" How cool is that? It also allows you to easily attach content, geo tags, Google Maps, and more to posts, pages, widgets, and custom templates with just a few simple options, shortcodes, or even PHP code. Say goodbye to manual location lookups and hello to personalized greetings for your visitors. Plus, it's fully compatible with popular plugins like WooCommerce, Contact Form 7, Yoast SEO, and WP Super Cache.

But that's not all, Geo Controller for WordPress also lets you specify a default location for your entire website, do SEO redirection, spam protection, and even control your WooCommerce store. Want to increase conversions and capture leads on your blog or landing pages? Geo Controller can help you with that too. With its advanced SEO capabilities and lead generation tools, it's the perfect tool to help you boost your website's performance and reach new heights.

But wait, there's more! Geo Controller also utilizes a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to distribute the data, which means lightning-fast loading times for your website. And let's not forget about saving space on your servers. By using an API, Geo Controller allows you to store less data locally, which means more room for all of your other important website data.

Lastly, Geo Controller can help you to comply with legal requirements by filtering legal notices, text, forms, etc. from countries for whom that content may not be relevant. This can help you to avoid legal issues and provide a better user experience for your visitors.

= FREE AND PAID SERVICES =

Geo Controller for WordPress is completely free! But, just like a superhero needs their trusty sidekick, Geo Controller also works with [paid services](https://cfgeoplugin.com/information/new-plugin-new-features-new-success/) that give you unlimited information about your website's visitors. However, for the free users, the API services are [limited to 1000 lookups](https://cfgeoplugin.com/documentation/quick-start/frequently-asked-questions/how-does-lookup-work) per day. But don't worry, if you want to take your location detection game to the next level, you can upgrade to UNLIMITED lookups by visiting our [official website](https://cfgeoplugin.com/pricing/).

And the best part? We often have monthly promotions and discounts, so don't forget to check out our [pricing page](https://cfgeoplugin.com/pricing/) on the official website for more information.

Geo Controller works as a [service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service), so sit back, relax, and let the plugin do all the hard work for you.

= Basics usage and example =

`[cfgeo_flag]
[cfgeo]
[cfgeo_city]
[cfgeo return="region"]
We just found shoes in [cfgeo_city] that you can buy for 50% discount.
[cfgeo ip="127.0.0.1" return="area_code"]
[cfgeo exclude="Toronto"] This text is seeing by everyone except Toronto people [/cfgeo]
[cfgeo include="New York"] This text seeing only people from New York [/cfgeo]
[in_eu]You are from the European Union[/in_eu]
[not_in_eu]You are NOT from the European Union[/not_in_eu]
[is_vat]You are under VAT[/is_vat]
[is_not_vat]You are NOT under VAT[/is_not_vat]`

= Usage & Example =

To best understand how shortcodes work, it's best to [read the documentation](https://cfgeoplugin.com/documentation/quick-start/cf-geoplugin-shortcodes/).

But here are some simple examples:

The Geo Controller allows you to add location-based functionality to your website. It is a simple plugin to use, after installation and activation, you just need to insert the shortcode **`[cfgeo]`** in your post or page. This shortcode returns and displays the IP address of the visitor.

You can also display different location-based information by using the return attribute in the shortcode. For example, to display the region of the visitor, you can use the shortcode **`[cfgeo return="region"]`**. By changing the return attribute, you can display any information from the list provided by the plugin. Each user visiting the site will see information related to their area.

Additionally, you can also track custom IP addresses and return information from that IP by adding an optional attribute called ip. For example, **`[cfgeo ip="127.0.0.1" return="area_code"]`** will return the area code from that IP address.

If the plugin is unable to locate the information, you can add a default value to the shortcode by using the default attribute. For example, **`[cfgeo return="country_code" default="US"]`** will return "US" if the plugin is unable to locate the country code.

You can exclude or include content on your page based on the user's location by using the `exclude` or `include` attribute. For example,

`[cfgeo exclude="Toronto, Québec"] This text is seeing by everyone except people from Toronto and Québec [/cfgeo]`

will hide the content "This text is seeing by everyone except people from Toronto and Québec" from the visitors that are located in Toronto or Québec.

Similarly, if you want to display some content only to specific location you can use include attribute like this:

`[cfgeo include="New York, Miami, Germany"] This text seeing only people from New York, Miami and Germany [/cfgeo]`

this shortcode will only display the text "This text seeing only people from New York, Miami and Germany" to the visitors that are located in New York, Miami and Germany.

You can also use the include and exclude attributes with country codes, region codes, or city codes. For example, you can use **`[cfgeo include="US, GB, DE"]`** to only display the content to visitors located in the United States, Great Britain, and Germany. Or you can use **`[cfgeo exclude="CA, ON, QUE"]`** to hide the content from visitors located in the provinces of California, Ontario, and Québec in Canada.

By using these attributes you can control the content visibility based on user location and personalize the user experience.

Please note that you need to use accurate location name to include or exclude content and case sensitive location name.

**VAT CONTROL:** If you need to show *value-added tax (VAT)* information on your website, there are 2 shortcodes that can help you with it.

`[is_vat]You are under VAT[/is_vat]
[is_not_vat]You are NOT under VAT[/is_not_vat]`

Both shortcodes have a default option that you can use as an alternative.

`[is_vat default="You are NOT under VAT"]You are under VAT[/is_vat]
[is_not_vat default="You are under VAT"]You are NOT under VAT[/is_not_vat]`

Generally, these two shortcodes show or hide everything inside it, depending on your needs.

**EU CONTROL:** If you need to display some content related to *European Union (EU)* countries, you can do it on the two easy way:

`[in_eu]You are from the European Union[/in_eu]
[not_in_eu]You are NOT from the European Union[/not_in_eu]`

Like many of our shortcodes, there is default options what you can use as an alternative:

`[in_eu default="You are NOT from the European Union"]You are from the European Union[/in_eu]
[not_in_eu defauilt="You are from the European Union"]You are NOT from the European Union[/not_in_eu]`

These two shortcodes also show or hide everything inside it, depending on your needs.

**GOOGLE MAP:** If you want to place a simple Google Map in your post or page, you just need to place a shortcode [cfgeo_map] and your visitor will see their own location on Google Map by default.

Like example, you can display own company street address inside Google Map like this: `[cfgeo_map longitude="-74.0059" latitude="40.7128" zoom="15"]` and pointer will show your street and place where you work.

Google Map also allow you to use HTML inside map and display info bar: 

`[cfgeo_map longitude="-74.0059" latitude="40.7128" zoom="15" title="My Company Name"] 
   <h3>My Company Name<h3> 
   <p>No Name Street 35, New York, USA</p> 
   <p>We have what you need</p> 
[/cfgeo_map]`

With this plugin you can easily set up your Google Map.

**GEO BANNER:** With this plugin you also have the ability to make dynamic content (text, images, banners, videos...) and target your messages to people from certain regions, track IP address, setup WordPress to work on user's timezone, etc. The possibilities are huge, you can increase conversions, use this plugin like support for your custom template, build your own plugin and use Geo Controller like additional options, etc.

You just need to create a new banner, place your content, select rules (country, region, city) save your banner, after that in your page pickup banner shortcode and place inside content.

**COUNTRY FLAG** You can display country flags in text or like images.

If you like to display country flag in your text like icon, you can do that simple like: 

`[cfgeo_flag]` - and you will see a flag in your text.

If you like to display country flag in your content like image, you can do that also simple using img or image attributes like: 

`[cfgeo_flag img]` - and you will see image flag in your content

You also can give custom sizes of flags in %, px, in, pt or em using size attribute like this: 

`[cfgeo_flag size="32px"]` - and you will see your flag in that size. You can use this size in image and normal text mode also.

You also can display custom flag using country attribute by placing country code simple like: 

`[cfgeo_flag country="ca"]` - and you will see a flag in your text or like image.

We allow you also full control of this flags and you can place css, class or id attributes to be able use this in any kind of work like this: 

`[cfgeo_flag size="50" css="padding:10px;" class="your-custom-class custom-class custom" id="top-flag"]`

Flags also support include & exclude attributes where you can controls your flag view:

`[cfgeo_flag exclude="ca,us"]` - and you will hide flag from the USA and Canada, for other is visible

or

`[cfgeo_flag include="ca,us"]` - and you will show flag only inside USA and Canada, for others is hidden

Installing Geo Controller for WordPress is a breeze. Just follow these simple steps:

* Upload the plugin files to the **/wp-content/plugins/cf-geoplugin** directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
* Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" screen in WordPress
* Go to the Geo Controller settings page and configure your settings
* That's it! You're ready to start greeting your visitors with personalized messages.

= On uninstall =

When you choose to uninstall the Geo Controller plugin, it's important to be aware that all data associated with the plugin will be permanently deleted from your WordPress installation. This includes the plugin's setup, license, and any other changes that you have made using the plugin. The plugin will clean everything from your database, and this process is irreversible, meaning that you will not be able to retrieve or restore any of the data that was generated by the plugin. So before you proceed with the uninstallation, it's important to make sure that you have a backup of any important data that you want to keep, or you have an alternative way to store the data.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is Geo Controller free? Is there some license or restrictions? =

Geo Controller uses a combination of free and paid services that return information about the locations.

Geo Controller is free by itself but API lookup is limited to 1000 lookups per day for the free users. If you need to have UNLIMITED lookup with NO RESTRICTIONS, please visit [official website](https://cfgeoplugin.com/pricing/) for more information regarding prices.

The reason for the payment of the license is obvious: -We have to pay the server we use to provide you information via API, development requires hours and hours of work at the daily level, the availability of the service must be 24/7 with no stop and for a lot of coffee.

Also you must know that few options like REST API, WooCommerce Payment Options, Spam Protection, Currency Converter are locked for the unlicensed usage because those options rely on the unlimited lookups and can break the website or stop working when you reach limits.

= Do Geo Controller use 3rd party services? =

Geo Controller is a geo information provider and we provide our own geo information via API services builded on the Geo Controller servers. Geo Controller has its own databases of IP addresses and geo locations related to that IP addresses. Geo Controller may use inside own API service and 3rd party API services like [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com/en/home), [GeoIP](http://php.net/manual/en/intro.geoip.php) and [Geo Plugin](https://www.geoplugin.com/) like additional support for the certain informations for the more precise location or currency information.

Note that Geo Controller DO NOT STORE any personal information without your knowledge and approval and not provide personal information to 3rd parties. Geo Controller not selling and not providing own databases to 3rd parties in any case. We handle only with world wide public information that is visible to anyone (client IP, server IP, hostname) and using simple processes we return geo information and following services.

For more informations you visit [Terms and Conditions](https://cfgeoplugin.com/terms-and-conditions) and [Privacy Policy](https://cfgeoplugin.com/privacy-policy) pages on our [official website](https://cfgeoplugin.com).

= How I can test Geo Controller is work on certain country, region or city? =

That part is a little bit hard but you can use great VPN service - [NordVPN](https://goo.gl/AEd82e)
With this service you can change your current location and test Geo Controller and its functionality.

= Can I use CF Geop Plugin inside a custom template? =

Yes! You can! You just need to follow instructions from your admin panel `http://siteexample.com/wp-admin/` area and use the `Settings->Geo Controller` to see all available shortcodes and settings.
NOTE: Some templates do not support WordPress PHP function `[do_shortcode()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/do_shortcode/)` and data from Geo Controller will not be visible.

= Can GeoPlugin slow down my site? =

NO, Geo Controller uses the asynchronous data reading from API services. After loading, all data is stored in a session. That session is stored until IP is changed. When the user's IP changes, the plugin reads new data and stores in the new session.

= Can I set the different value if the shortcode shows no results? =

YES, just add the attribute `default` in shortcode and corresponding text like this:
`[cfgeo return="city" default="Your Default Text"]`

= How to include CF Geop Plugin in PHP? =

In PHP you can use WordPress function `[do_shortcode()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/do_shortcode/)` to display data via shortcode inside your PHP file. Also you have option to use PHP class `new CF_Geoplugin` or you can use GLOBALS and get data via `global $CF_Geo` like example:

`
// check if plugin exists
if(class_exists("CF_Geoplugin")){
	// include plugin class
	$cfgeo = new CF_Geoplugin;
	// get data
	$geo = $cfgeo->get();
	// print data
	echo $geo->city;
}
`

or with globals:

`
// object oriented
global $CF_GEO;
echo $CF_GEO->city;

// Array
global $CFGEO;
echo $CFGEO['city'];
`

= How to use CF Geop Plugin inside JavaScript? =

JavaScript is enabled from version 5.2.0. In JavaScript you have 2 ways to get geo data from our plugin, using `cf.geoplugin` or `window.cfgeo` objects. These 2 objects contain all geo information from our plugin and are available inside the public and admin area.
`
<script>
	// Look in your console for all available objects
	console.log(window.cfgeo);
	
	// you can use this everywhere you want
	
	var city = window.cfgeo.city,
		state = window.cfgeo.state,
		country = window.cfgeo.country,
		ip = window.cfgeo.ip;
</script>
`

= How to use Geo Controller inside ContactForm7? =

Sometimes you need to include other HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and jQuery codes inside ContactForm7. Sometimes you need to insert a geolocation in input fields. This is not easy but here is one example with jQuery:

`
[text* city placeholder "* City Name"]
[text* country placeholder "* Country Name"]

<script>
jQuery(document).ready(function(){
    jQuery("input[name^='city']").val(window.cfgeo.city);
	jQuery("input[name^='country']").val(window.cfgeo.country);
});
</script>
`

This code will auto fill the value of CF7 city field when a visitor visits the contact page (look screenshots).

* All geo information you can find inside the global `window.cfgeo` object.

= Geo Controller don't display information =

* It might be an error with the provider's [geoPlugin](http://www.geoplugin.com/) network or API and Geo Controller can't display information on its own.
* Look inside `Geo Controller` for all available shortcodes and settings,
* Look inside `Geo Controller->Settings` and enable/disable and check all options (SSL, proxy, etc),
* Maybe you have PHP error, you can see that if you enable plugin debug in `wp-config.php` inserting on first lines code: `define('WP_CF_GEO_DEBUG', true);`
* Some people use a special software to hide IP address via proxy and geoplugin can't look deeper to get accurate location,
* Look into error.log file to see if a problem is in Geo Controller
* Some servers not allow access to geoplugin sites and maybe you need to use proxy settings inside plugin to enable tracking
* You reach some API limitations
